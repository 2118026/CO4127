        <h2>"Best time to visit Nepal"(Luxury Holiday Nepal, n.d.)</h2>
        <!-- Destination's description -->
        <p>“The best time to visit Nepal depends on your interests and the activities you want to do. The peak tourist
          seasons are during spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) when the weather is generally clear and
          stable, making it ideal for trekking, mountaineering, and sightseeing. Monsoon season (June-August) is less
          popular due to heavy rainfall, but it's great for experiencing lush green landscapes. Winter
          (December-February) can be cold, especially in higher altitudes, but it's still suitable for lower-altitude
          treks and cultural experiences.”(Luxury Holiday Nepal, n.d.)</p>

          International Airport in Kathmandu or at designated land border crossings. You will need a valid passport,
          passport-sized photos, and the visa fee in USD cash. Visa regulations and fees may change, so always check the
          latest information from the official website of the Department of Immigration of Nepal or the nearest Nepali
